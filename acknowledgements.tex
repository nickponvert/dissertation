\acknowledge{%Thanks go here.
Thanks to my patient wife Amanda, walk-deprived dog Flora, loving family, and supportive friends for everything I have been able to accomplish.

Extra thanks to everyone in the Jaramillo lab... etc. 

%Leave an extra space before the final curly bracket. At least for me I had some strange problem where the last line became single spaced if I didn't.
